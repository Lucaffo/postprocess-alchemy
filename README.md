Postprocess Alchemy is my own software developed in Unity. The main point to this project is to show, in a cool and simple way, the postprocessing effect made by myself in ShaderLab using HLSL and Universal Render Pipeline.

> You can see the effect by yourself downloading the last release of the project!
> I Want to special mention that the models inside the project is not done by myself, but were made by friend/collegue at The Sign Comics & Arts Academy.
