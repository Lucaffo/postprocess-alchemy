# Postprocess Alchemy
Postprocess Alchemy is a showcase software developed in Unity. The main point of this project is to show, in a cool and simple way, the postprocessing effect i made by in ShaderLab using HLSL and Universal Render Pipeline.

> You can test the effect by yourself downloading the last release of the project!
> I Want to special mention my friends/collegues at The Sign Comics & Arts Academy that made all the models!
